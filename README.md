# Scaling Power in League of Legends: Champion Win Rates Over Game Time

This project analyzes how different champions in League of Legends scale across game time by collecting and visualizing win rates over time using the Riot Games API. Instead of relying on static tier lists or subjective scaling opinions, this project uses real match data from one-trick players to showcase time-based performance trends.
